# Call-Center-Data-Analysis (Using Power-BI)
## Project Aims and Objectives 
## Aims:
*   To provide a centralized, real-time view of key call center performance indicators.
*   To enable data-driven decision-making for optimizing call center operations.
*   To improve customer service quality and efficiency.
## Objectives:
*   **Monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Track metrics such as total calls, average call duration, calls within SLA, CSAT scores, and channel performance.
*   **Identify Trends and Patterns:** Analyze data visualizations to identify trends in call volume, call duration, customer satisfaction, and channel usage.
*   **Analyze Root Causes:** Investigate the reasons behind long call duration's, low CSAT scores, and SLA breaches.
*   **Optimize Resource Allocation:** Identify peak call times, popular channels, and areas needing improvement to optimize staffing and resource allocation.
*   **Improve Customer Satisfaction:** Monitor CSAT scores and identify areas for improvement in customer service.
*   **Enhance Operational Efficiency:** Identify opportunities to reduce call duration, improve first-call resolution, and streamline processes.
*   **Track Performance Over Time:** Monitor trends over time to assess the impact of changes and identify areas for continuous improvement.
*   **Provide Actionable Insights:** Generate insights that can be used to inform decisions, such as agent training, process improvements, and technology investments.
  
## Dataset Used 
You can access the dataset and resources <a href = "https://github.com/Empress36/Call-Center-Data-Analysis-Power-BI-/blob/main/Call%20Center%20Report%20Analysis.pbix">here<a/>

## Summary 
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of call center performance. It displays key metrics like the total number of calls, average call duration, Above SLA Calls, Within SLA Calls and Below SLA Calls. The dashboard breaks down call volume by channel and response time, offering insights into how customers are contacting the center and how quickly their needs are being addressed.
Additionally, it visualizes Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores based on sentiment, it’s allow to understand the emotional impact on customer experiences. The dashboard also highlights the top 5 states by call volume, which can inform resource allocation and regional strategies. Overall, the dashboard is designed to monitor performance, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance customer service efficiency and satisfaction.



## Tools Used
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
*  Power BI - Main data visualization platform used for report creation 
*  SQL - For data cleaning and preprocessing 
*  DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) - For calculated measures, dynamic visuals and conditional logic
*  Data Modelling - For creating relationship among tables
  
## Question (KPIs)
**Primary KPI's:-** Total Calls, Average Calls Duration and SLA Calls (Above,Within and Below)

**Secondary KPI's:**
*  Total Calls by Channel
*  Total Calls by Response Time
*  Top 5 State by Total Calls
*  Call Duration by Reason
*  Csat (customer satisfaction) by Sentiment
*  Monthly trend by Sum of Call Duration and Total Call by Month

## Insights
*  The call distribution by channel allows you to see which channels (e.g. call center, chatbot) are most used by customers. This helps in    understanding customer preferences.
*  Based on the chart, it shows how quickly agents are responding to customer inquiries, which you can see that Above SLA is 63%, Within      SLA is 25% and below SLA is 13%.
*  This analyze the breakdown of calls by state offers a geographical perspective on call center operations, which can be useful for           identifying regional trends or issues.
*  This identifies the most common reasons for calls and their duration, where Billing Question has the highest percentage.
*  The analysis helps in understanding customer satisfactions, how they feel about their interactions and identifying areas for customer      service improvement.
*  This allows the monitoring trends and identifying any seasonal patterns or performance changes over time.

## Recommendations
*  Based on the insights I would suggest to evaluate the performance of each channel (call  center, chatbot, email and web)and identify       which channels have the highest call volumes and customers satisfaction scores. This will help in optimizing resource allocation and       improving customer experience.
*  From the insights gotten from the chart, I would recommend Implementing strategies to reduce wait times and ensure agents and ensure       agents are readily available to assist customers.
*  Monitor the level performance of each state and tailor support strategies based on the states with the highest call volumes. This might    involve offering specialized support or adjusting staffing levels
*  Based on the insight, focus on resolving the issues that are causing the longest call durations most especially the Billing question       reason. You can tackle this issue by providing better agent training or streamlining processes.
*  Monitor the sentiment analysis to identify and address issues causing negative customer experience. Investigate the reasons behind         negative feedback and implement corrective actions, such as improving agent training or resolving common customer issues.
*  I would recommend to regularly monitor the trends in call volume and duration. This will help in identifying seasonal patterns             measuring the impact of implemented.
