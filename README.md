# Call-Center-Data-Analysis (Using Power-BI)
## Project Aims and Objectives 
## Aims:
*   To provide a centralized, real-time view of key call center performance indicators.
*   To enable data-driven decision-making for optimizing call center operations.
*   To improve customer service quality and efficiency.
## Objectives:
*   **Monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Track metrics such as total calls, average call duration, calls within SLA, CSAT scores, and channel performance.
*   **Identify Trends and Patterns:** Analyze data visualizations to identify trends in call volume, call duration, customer satisfaction, and channel usage.
*   **Analyze Root Causes:** Investigate the reasons behind long call duration's, low CSAT scores, and SLA breaches.
*   **Optimize Resource Allocation:** Identify peak call times, popular channels, and areas needing improvement to optimize staffing and resource allocation.
*   **Improve Customer Satisfaction:** Monitor CSAT scores and identify areas for improvement in customer service.
*   **Enhance Operational Efficiency:** Identify opportunities to reduce call duration, improve first-call resolution, and streamline processes.
*   **Track Performance Over Time:** Monitor trends over time to assess the impact of changes and identify areas for continuous improvement.
*   **Provide Actionable Insights:** Generate insights that can be used to inform decisions, such as agent training, process improvements, and technology investments.
