# Call-Center-Data-Analysis (Using Power-BI)
## Project Aims and Objectives 
## Aims:
*   To provide a centralized, real-time view of key call center performance indicators.
*   To enable data-driven decision-making for optimizing call center operations.
*   To improve customer service quality and efficiency.
## Objectives:
*   **Monitor Key Performance Indicators (KPIs):** Track metrics such as total calls, average call duration, calls within SLA, CSAT scores, and channel performance.
*   **Identify Trends and Patterns:** Analyze data visualizations to identify trends in call volume, call duration, customer satisfaction, and channel usage.
*   **Analyze Root Causes:** Investigate the reasons behind long call duration's, low CSAT scores, and SLA breaches.
*   **Optimize Resource Allocation:** Identify peak call times, popular channels, and areas needing improvement to optimize staffing and resource allocation.
*   **Improve Customer Satisfaction:** Monitor CSAT scores and identify areas for improvement in customer service.
*   **Enhance Operational Efficiency:** Identify opportunities to reduce call duration, improve first-call resolution, and streamline processes.
*   **Track Performance Over Time:** Monitor trends over time to assess the impact of changes and identify areas for continuous improvement.
*   **Provide Actionable Insights:** Generate insights that can be used to inform decisions, such as agent training, process improvements, and technology investments.

## Summary 
This dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of call center performance. It displays key metrics like the total number of calls, average call duration, Above SLA Calls, Within SLA Calls and Below SLA Calls. The dashboard breaks down call volume by channel and response time, offering insights into how customers are contacting the center and how quickly their needs are being addressed.
Additionally, it visualizes Customer Satisfaction (CSAT) scores based on sentiment, it’s allow to understand the emotional impact on customer experiences. The dashboard also highlights the top 5 states by call volume, which can inform resource allocation and regional strategies. Overall, the dashboard is designed to monitor performance, identify areas for improvement, and make data-driven decisions to enhance customer service efficiency and satisfaction.



## Tools Used
The dashboard was built using the following tools and technologies:
*  Power BI - Main data visualization platform used for report creation 
*  SQL - For data cleaning and preprocessing 
*  DAX (Data Analysis Expressions) - For calculated measures, dynamic visuals and conditional logic
*  Data Modelling - For creating relationship among tables
  
## Question (KPIs)
**Primary KPI's:-** Total Calls, Average Calls Duration and SLA Calls (Above,Within and Below)

**Secondary KPI's:**
*  Total Calls by Channel
*  Total Calls by Response Time
*  Top 5 State by Total Calls
*  Call Duration by Reason
*  Csat (customer satisfaction) by Sentiment
*  Monthly trend by Sum of Call Duration and Total Call by Month
